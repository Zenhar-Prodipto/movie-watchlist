üå≥ Gitflow

I used a Gitflow-inspired workflow to keep development organized:

develop: Default branch for ongoing development and integration of new features.

main: Production-ready branch with stable, release-ready code.

feat/\*: Feature branches for new functionality (e.g., feat/cosmetic-surgery for styling and password toggle), created from develop.

fix/\*: Bug fix branches created from develop (not used in this project).

Workflow

Create a Branch:

Branch from develop:

git checkout develop
git checkout -b feat/<feature-name>

Develop and Commit:

Write code and commit with semantic messages:

git commit -m "feat: Add eye icon toggle for password"

Push to GitHub:

Push the feature branch:

git push origin feat/<feature-name>

Merge to develop:

Create a pull request from feat/<feature-name> to develop.

Merge after review.

Merge to main:

Periodically merge develop to main for production releases:

git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main

Commits

Semantic messages (e.g., feat: Add eye icon toggle, fix: Correct Inter font) for clarity.
