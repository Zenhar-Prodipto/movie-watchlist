## üå≥ Gitflow

I used a Gitflow-inspired workflow to keep development organized:

- `develop`: Default branch for ongoing development and integration of new features.
- `main`: Production-ready branch with stable, release-ready code.
- `feat/_`: Feature branches for new functionality (e.g., `feat/cosmetic-surgery` for styling and password toggle), created from develop.
- `fix/_`: Bug fix branches created from develop (not used in this project).

### Workflow

1. **Create a Branch**:

   - Branch from develop:
     ```bash
     git checkout develop
     git checkout -b feat/<feature-name>
     ```

2. **Develop and Commit**:

   - Write code and commit with semantic messages:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "feat: Add eye icon toggle for password"
     ```

3. **Push to GitHub**:

   - Push the feature branch:
     ```bash
     git push origin feat/<feature-name>
     ```

4. **Merge to develop**:

   - Create a pull request from `feat/<feature-name>` to `develop`.
   - Merge after review.

5. **Merge to main**:
   - Periodically merge develop to main for production releases:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git merge develop
     git push origin main
     ```

### Commits

- Semantic messages (e.g., `feat: Add eye icon toggle`, `fix: Correct Inter font`) for clarity.
